# Explanation 
This is a repo to illustrate my problems with the combination of packer puphpet and puppet. https://github.com/chef/bento is the basis I try to build upon.

I am using their basebox **ubuntu-14.04-amd64.json**
# Bento

Bento is a project that encapsulates [Packer](http://packer.io) templates for building
[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) baseboxes. We use these boxes internally at Chef Software, Inc. for
testing Hosted Chef, Chef Server and our open source [cookbooks](https://supermarket.chef.io/users/chef)
via [test-kitchen](http://kitchen.ci/).
